## Custom Payload Encoder & Obfuscation Framework

# Project Overview

The Custom Payload Encoder & Obfuscation Framework is a Python-based internship project designed to demonstrate how payloads can be transformed to evade basic signature-based detection mechanisms. The project implements common encoding techniques such as Base64, XOR, and ROT13, along with multiple string obfuscation methods to modify the static representation of a payload while preserving its original intent. A simulated detection module using simple pattern-matching logic is used to compare the effectiveness of original, encoded, and obfuscated payloads. Through this controlled and ethical implementation, the project highlights the limitations of static detection approaches and emphasizes the importance of layered security strategies in modern cybersecurity environments.
